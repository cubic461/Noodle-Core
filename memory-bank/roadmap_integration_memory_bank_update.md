## 1. Context Digests

### 1.1 Roadmap Integration Summary
**Project**: Noodle Roadmap Vision Integration
**Date**: 2025-09-23
**Status**: Planning Complete, Ready for Implementation

**Key Integration Points**:
- **Existing Foundation**: Stappen 1-4 completed (Language Prototype, Tooling, Distributed Runtime, Optimization Layer)
- **Vision Integration**: Added hybrid architecture, intent-based optimization, progressive migration phases
- **Extended Roadmap**: Stappen 5-9 now include full system, advanced features, and future extensions

**Files Updated**:
- [`memory-bank/roadmap.md`](memory-bank/roadmap.md) - Added hybrid architecture, enhanced optimization
- [`memory-bank/noodle-ide-roadmap.md`](memory-bank/noodle-ide-roadmap.md) - Added bridge phases, dependency elimination
- [`memory-bank/python_transpiler_roadmap.md`](memory-bank/python_transpiler_roadmap.md) - Extended with interop, shadow execution, progressive transpilation

### 1.2 Vision Alignment
**Core Vision Elements**:
1. **Noodle-IDE Independence**: Progressive migration from Flask/React to native Noodle UI/API
2. **Python Migration**: Interop runtime → shadow profiling → transpilation → optimization
