# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socioeconomic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Inclusive Language Guidelines

We strive to use inclusive language in all communications:

### Use Inclusive Terms

Instead of potentially exclusionary terms, consider:

- **Instead of** "guys" → **use** "folks", "everyone", "team", or "y'all"
- **Instead of** "master/slave" → **use** "primary/secondary", "leader/follower", or "controller/worker"
- **Instead of** "whitelist/blacklist" → **use** "allowlist/denylist" or "include/exclude"
- **Instead of** "sanity check" → **use** "coherence check", "validation", or "verification"
- **Instead of** "cripple" or other ableist language → **use** "disable", "impair", or specific technical descriptions

### Gender-Neutral Language

- Use "they" as a singular pronoun when gender is unknown or irrelevant
- Avoid gendered job titles (e.g., use "chairperson" instead of "chairman")
- Refer to people by their chosen name and pronouns

### Cultural Sensitivity

- Be mindful of cultural references that may not translate across cultures
- Avoid idioms or expressions that are specific to one region or culture
- Use clear, direct language that can be easily understood by non-native speakers

## Conflict Resolution

We believe that healthy conflict resolution leads to better outcomes for everyone.

### When Issues Arise

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior:

1. **Address it directly (if safe)** - If you feel comfortable doing so, politely but firmly address the behavior with the person involved
2. **Seek support** - Reach out to a community moderator or maintainer for assistance
3. **Report formally** - For serious incidents, submit a formal report to the conduct committee

### Resolution Process

We are committed to addressing issues fairly and promptly:

1. **Initial Response** - We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours
2. **Investigation** - We will investigate the situation thoroughly and objectively
3. **Resolution** - We will take appropriate action based on the findings
4. **Follow-up** - We will follow up with all parties involved to ensure resolution

### Consequences

Unacceptable behavior will not be tolerated. Consequences may include:

- **Private warning** - Private communication explaining the issue and how to avoid it in the future
- **Public warning** - Public clarification of the standards and the specific violation
