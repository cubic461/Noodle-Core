## Sample Code Files to Prepare

### File 1: main.py (for completion demo)
```python
import os
import sys
from utils import helper

def main():
    # Show auto-completion here
    path = os.path.
    # Complete with .path.join, .getcwd, etc.
    
    helper.calculate_total([1, 2, 3])
```

### File 2: utils/helper.py (for go-to-definition)
```python
# Navigation target
def calculate_total(numbers):
    total = sum(numbers)
    return total
```

### File 3: patterns.py (for pattern matching)
```python
# Advanced pattern matching demo
def process_data(data):
    match data:
        case {"type": "user", "name": str(name)}:
            return f"User: {name}"
        case {"type": "admin", "permissions": [*perms]}:
            return f"Admin with {len(perms)} permissions"
        case _:
            return "Unknown"
```

### File 4: fibonacci.py (for AI demo)
