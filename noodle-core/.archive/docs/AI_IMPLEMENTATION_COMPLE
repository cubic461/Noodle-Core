## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### AI Analysis Engine

```python
# Real-time code analysis with intelligent suggestions
def analyze_code(context):
    # Multi-language syntax parsing
    # Complexity analysis
    # Security vulnerability detection
    # Performance optimization recommendations
    # Confidence scoring for all suggestions
```

### Monaco Editor Integration

```javascript
// Seamless integration with Monaco Editor
window.noodleCoreAI = {
    analyzeCode: (code, language) => fetch('/api/v1/ai/analyze', {...}),
    getCompletions: (code, position) => fetch('/api/v1/ai/completions', {...}),
    getSuggestions: (context) => fetch('/api/v1/ai/suggest', {...})
};
```

### Self-Improvement Integration

```python
# Learning from user interactions
class AILearningSystem:
    def record_feedback(self, suggestion_id, user_response):
        # Update AI models based on user acceptance/rejection
        # Improve suggestion quality over time
        # Adapt to user coding patterns
```

## 🎮 Demo and Testing

### Running the Demonstration

```bash
# Start the enhanced server
python -m noodlecore.api.server_enhanced --debug
