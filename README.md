# Noodle-Core

Noodle-Core is a foundational execution and intelligence platform for AI-augmented software systems, built around the **NoodleCore language**.

It provides a compiler and runtime, an agent framework, an integrated data layer, and multi-language LSP support to reason about, transform, and execute software across languages and environments.

## What is NoodleCore?

NoodleCore is a symbolic programming language designed to act as a stable interface between humans, AI systems, and executable software.

Rather than focusing on syntax alone, NoodleCore emphasizes:
- semantic structure
- intent-driven representation
- explicit execution and transformation rules

This allows software to be:
- reasoned about programmatically
- transformed across languages
- partially generated or modified by AI systems
- executed within a controlled and inspectable runtime

In Noodle-Core, the language is not an add-on — it is the organizing principle.
Everything in the system ultimately becomes NoodleCore.

## Platform Overview

Noodle-Core combines several tightly integrated components:

- **NoodleCore Compiler**  
  Translates NoodleCore programs into executable representations.

- **Runtime**  
  Executes NoodleCore programs with explicit control over execution flow and state.

- **Agent Framework**  
  Enables AI-assisted and autonomous processes to operate within defined symbolic boundaries.

- **Data Layer**  
  Provides persistent, inspectable state for programs, agents, and transformations.

- **Multi-language LSP Support**  
  Allows Noodle-Core to interface with existing codebases across 40+ programming languages.

Together, these components form a coherent execution and reasoning substrate rather than a collection of independent tools.

## Project Status

Noodle-Core is under active development.

The architecture and language are evolving, and stability guarantees are not yet provided.
Expect breaking changes as the core concepts are refined.

## Philosophy

Noodle-Core is built with the belief that:
- programming languages are contracts, not just syntax
- AI systems should operate within explicit symbolic structures
- execution, reasoning, and transformation belong in the same system

The goal is not to replace existing languages, but to provide a stable core that can connect them.
